## Challenge 3: Start Coding - Trainer Notes

### Challenge Objective

Transition from UI-based implementation to code-based RAG solution using Python and LangChain.

### Key Components

1. Environment Setup

   - Configure .env file with credentials
   - Set up Python environment with required packages

2. Implementation Steps
   - Test vanilla models via API
   - Implement document loading
   - Create vector store
   - Build RAG chain with LangChain

### Technologies Used

- LangChain Framework
- Azure OpenAI API
- Azure AI Search
- Python Jupyter Notebooks

### Key Concepts to Cover

- Document chunking strategies
- Vector store implementation
- LangChain chains and agents
- Prompt engineering

### Success Criteria

- Working Jupyter notebook implementation
- Successful API interactions
- RAG responses matching UI implementation

### Trainer Notes

- Help with Python environment issues
- Explain LangChain concepts clearly
- Compare results with Challenge 2
- Emphasize error handling and best practices
