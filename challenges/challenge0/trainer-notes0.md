## Challenge 0: Learn the Basics - Summary for Trainers

### Challenge Objective

Introduce participants to fundamental concepts of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and its implementation in Azure.

### Key Learning Points

- LLM basics (parameters, tokens, context windows)
- RAG architecture and components
- Document chunking and embedding concepts
- Azure technologies used in RAG solutions

### Technologies Covered

- Azure AI Search
- Azure OpenAI/Microsoft Phi-3.5
- LangChain
- Chainlit (UI)

### Important Discussion Points

1. Data quality impact on RAG performance
2. Chunking strategy effects
3. RAG vs Fine-tuning use cases
4. RAG limitations and strengths

### Success Criteria

Participants should be able to:

- Explain RAG components and interactions
- Understand chunking/embedding role
- Identify suitable RAG use cases

### Trainer Notes

- Focus on conceptual understanding rather than implementation
- Encourage discussion about real-world applications
- Emphasize the importance of data preparation in RAG solutions

RAG Strengths:

- Real-time, up-to-date information
- Flexible knowledge updates
- Better factual accuracy
- Good for broad knowledge tasks

RAG Limitations:

- Higher latency
- More complex implementation
- Higher inference costs
- Not ideal for specialized tasks

Fine-tuning Strengths:

- Specialized domain expertise
- Lower inference latency
- Better style/tone control
- Consistent responses

Fine-tuning Limitations:

- Requires retraining for updates
- Higher initial training costs
- Can hallucinate outside domain
- Static knowledge base
